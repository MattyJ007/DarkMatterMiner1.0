About GMATo

GMATo
Genome-wide Microsatellite Analyzing Tool (GMATo) is a novel soft for faster and accurate microsatellite mining at any length and comprehensive statistical analysis for DNA sequences in any genome at any size, with easily customized parameters control for biologists and bio-informatician, running easily at common computers with Windows, Linux, MAC OS etc multiple platforms (platform independently) with both graphic and command interface programmed in Java and Perl computing language. 



Software GMATo is a one-step tool for Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) or microsatellite, characterization in any genome and for facilitating SSR marker designing in genome scale. The program was easily analyzed all SSRs in 2G Zea mays genome.



Only one input file is required which contains DNA sequences in raw fasta format and output files in tabular format list all SSR loci information and statistical distribution at four biologist interested classifications. 



The program consists of three major functional modules: i) format sequence module, ii) SSR search and processing module and iii) statistic module. Each module can run independently or sub-sequentially. Module GMAT in Java or Perl integrates all above modules.detailed usage of GMATo is well documented in manual or help.PDF. The soft GMATo is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmato/files/?source=navbar    or on contact.
